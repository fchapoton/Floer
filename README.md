# Floer

This is a python package calculating the knot Floer Homology.

This still experimental python program calculates the knot Floer
homology of a knot. The program is started by executing main.py, its
main output is an array containing for each Alexander and Maslov
grading the rank of the homology group.

The running time of the program is sometimes huge. Further faster
versions should appear. The program is based on the work of Stephen
J. Bigelow and Anna Beliakova, itself prolongating the now classical
combinatorial description of knot Floer homology.

The author of the initial code is Jean-Marie Droz.

This works with both Python2 and Python3.
